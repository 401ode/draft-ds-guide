title: User-Centered Design

#### There's a reason we put this one first.

### Context
You may find yourself in a position where you, in your public-oriented wisdom, realize that you may need to go forward and commence a **technology project**. If so - and this may sound intuitive but it's unbelievably crucial to *actually* do it - the first thing you need to do is **talk to the people who are going to use or be impacted by the technology.**

You are really smart. You know your department/division/agency/office/program and the citizens it serves really well. Of course you do. But even you, a smart, inspiring public servant, are making assumptions about how your department/division/agency/office/program and the citizens it serves operate that do not jive with reality. It's not your fault - it's inherent. You may think that anything you might uncover by asking your potential users would be puny, insignificant details. But sometimes asking someone how they **would like** to interact with a system is enough to reframe the conversation on what really matters. Your project may not need to be as big as you thought.

#### Context: Horse/Barn Scenario
If you've already gone to RFP on this and haven't built in any language on user-centered or user-oriented design, that's fine. All this is new stuff to State Government.

##### Tool: ODE Eval Member
If you have a member of ODE on your evaluation committee, then they should be aware enough to at least evaluate vendors on how user-centric their solutions are.

##### Tool: A User Lens in Evaluations
If not, then go for it: read RFP responses in the light of: "Was this solution designed to solve real user needs? Does this vendor indicate that their solution is the offshoot of really knowing how to solve my users' problems?"

**Caveat:** Because of our Division of Purchases regulations and the associated State procurement laws, and the particular language of the RFP you've put out, it may not be possible for you to use this particular lens in your evaluation. In general, though, most RFPs have a "Capabilities of the Offeror" or an "Overall Response Quality" section. It is the opinion of ODE that in some cases (all situations are different), it may be justifiable to incorporate this user-centricity lens to your personal or team evaluation of an RFP response. Check with the Division of Purchases before you do anything crazy.
