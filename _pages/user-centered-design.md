#### There's a reason we put this one first.

### Context
You may find yourself in a position where you, in your public-oriented wisdom, realize that you may need to go forward and commence a **technology project**. If so - and this may sound intuitive but it's unbelievably crucial to *actually* do it - the first thing you need to do is **talk to the people who are going to use or be impacted by the technology.**

#### Horse/Barn Scenario
If you've already gone to RFP on this and haven't built in any language on user-centered or user-oriented design, that's fine. All this is new stuff to State Government.
