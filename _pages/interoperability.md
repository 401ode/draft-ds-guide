#### Tool/Text
The solution should make it easy to a non-technical State user to define certain data elements that either individually or in aggregate totals should be reportable to the public. Data elements so identified should be immediately accessible via modern, RESTful, public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The solution’s security and authentication architecture should also permit the State to set up “system users” to access all solution data from other State systems.

#### Why
Becuase we should publish information in ways that make it easy to find, access, share, distribute, and re-purpose; Structure content and tag with standard metadata. Make open data, content, and application programming interfaces (APIs) the new default, and make existing high-value data and content available through APIs.

Machines are more effecient at talking to each other than humans.  We need to get out of the way and give machines "phone numbers" in order to call each other!

System need to talk to each other
