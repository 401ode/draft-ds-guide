title: Authentication
---

**Context**


**Tool/Text**
The State will give due consideration to solutions who allow for Single-Sign On (SSO) for State users via the State’s existing Azure Active Directory (Office 365) infrastructure. This SSO functionality can be achieved using SAML 2.0, WS-Federation, or OpenID connection protocols. However, not all prospective users of the solution will be State employees. As such, the solution should provide an alternative authentication mechanism for non-state users (e.g. contractors). Offerors should clearly define their login and account maintenance models for these non-State users in any responses (i.e. options for multi-factor authentication, “no password” secure authentication, encryption standards for credentials, etc.).

**Why**
Registries are important tools
