title: Accessibility

**Context**
(Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act)[https://www.section508.gov/content/learn/laws-and-policies] 
(World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Authoring Guidelines, Version 2)[https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php]

**Tool/Text**
The platform must be in compliance with the accessibility principles of Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act and the standards documented in the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Authoring Guidelines, Version 2, Level AA (WCAG2 Standards).  Towards that end, accessibility considerations should be built into every phase of the project.  Accessibility tests should be conducted before delivery and include testing results with all deliverables. 

**Why**
Right thing to do.  Also don't get sued.
